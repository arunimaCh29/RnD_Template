# R&D Project Report Latex Template

This is a template for R&D project reports in the Autonomous Systems master's program at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, using the `IEEETran` class.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have `texlive-full` installed so that you don't face any compilation errors (on Ubuntu systems, you can install it with `sudo apt install texlive-full`).

## Usage

The main file of the report is `report.tex`; the abstract, individual sections, and the appendix are included as separate files in the `subfiles` directory.

If there are any problems, don't hesitate to let us know. You can open an issue [here](https://github.com/a2s-institute/rnd-project-report/issues/new).

## Report Submission Notes

When submitting a report, the name of the PDF should be changed to match the naming convention specified in the MAS Vital Information, namely `LastNameI-RnDReport`. For example, John Doe would name his file `DoeJ-RnDReport.pdf`.

## Note About Naming Your Sections

Some section names here are very generic since this is a template; however, feel free to modify them/make them more concrete based on your needs! In other words, the names in your report don't have to be the same as in the template (although you will want to keep at least the names of the introduction, related work, and conclusions chapters unchanged).
